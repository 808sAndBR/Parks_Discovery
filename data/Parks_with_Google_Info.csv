It is bordered by scenic wonders of the California coast, beautiful beaches of the Pacific Ocean and hiking trails that are filled with wild life. Bird watching on hikes and picnics is really great. So, while the family enjoys the beach and hiking you can play golf then join them for swimming, surfing or hiking, bird watching and the picnic after your round.  

I've been playing Sharps for over 20 years. I've never seen it in better shape than at this point in time. Now, it's not 100% just yet. But the greens are better than I've ever seen them. And the fairways even with this horrible drought are in are in good shape and in some places they're as good as you'll get anywhere. I must admit 16,17 are so dried out it will be a wonder if they ever recover but with the great grounds crew they have those fairway will come back. 

Sharps is a terrific golf course challenging in its own way especially because your playing on an ocean fronted course. Ocean view golf is usually played out for multiple hundreds of dollars on courses like Spanish Bay, Torrey Pines or Pebble Beach, but Sharps is a Muni so the greens fees are a pittance in comparison.

The clubhouse staff, grounds keepers and Marshals are salt of the earth. The restaurant is pretty darn good . . . well, you know  . . . for golf course food it's better than most public courses.

It's not Saint Andrews, or Pebble Beach, or Harding or the Olympic club. It's not too challenging . . . so if you put three good shots together, per hole, it's fairly easy to break 90.

Once those 16 and 17th fairways are fixed this is a Five Star course any day of the week!
The front nine holes are terrible. Four of the nine holes had temporary ""greens"" on the fairway. You couldn't putt the ball. The back nine were better. The fairways are in poor condition but the greens are fine. This may be because of the drought. Other golf courses seem to be doing ok so I'm not sure what the deal is here. I guess you get what you pay for. I'd much rather drive to Poplar Creek in San Mateo or just play the 9 holes at Fleming.There's lots of wildlife there, including the rare and beautiful San Francisco Garter Snake and its prey species, the California Red Legged Frog. The golf course is sited on a wetland, and just recentyl, SF Rec & Park got the ok to channelize the streams - so they can manage the wetland for a golf course. This will remove wetlands for wildlife.  The two times I had breakfast there the coffee cake was burned, and the coffee was weak.A beautiful area that should be available to everyone and turned into a national park. Whoever made this a golf course did not think about sharing the beauty with all earth citizens. Shut it down.Great value for money. Greens are getting better, but still pretty slow. It's a great place to just walk, loosen your muscles and practice."

Too bad the TL is losing kids according to the census 
I am not surprised since so many of them become latchkey kids and become prisoners in their own home because of the dangerous activities that never end on the streets. 
Face it Glide is next to Boeddeker and that draws too many thugs on drugs 
The police station does not help they still blatantly deal drugs when the cops leave 
The kids notice the activity 
The JC Decaux bathroom is nothing less than a CRACK SHACK

It's a bit frustrating to visit many different parks, some of the only grassy areas in the city, just to be told that dogs aren't actually allowed in the grass. The location is great, the views are gorgeous, and there are always quite a few dogs/walkers there!Fantastic little park nestled in the heart of Nob Hill. Grace Cathedral is right across the street and there are plenty of benches to grab a seat and hang out.

San Francisco is big on dogs; this park will make that very clear. Lots of cool pups running around doing what they do best. The park is lit up in Christmas lights during the holiday season, so you should definitely swing by if you're around. Amazing view of the grace cathedral. I sat on a bench and relaxed. Great views. Love seeing the dogs, the tai chi in the mornings and the sound of the fountain. This is a great oasis, and very peaceful.  "

Not as big or popular like the big apple, but it holds a tradition. Union hold monthly events during warmer weather months. Winter holidays they've ice skating. Small boutique shops as well as big brand name shops are abundance. Love this area as I can play tourist just to get a feel what's its like. It never disappoint me due to the fact that transportation brings you in the heart of the action.Great open area that always has something going on whether it's Santacon or Valentine's Day. It's also nearby to some great shops and is a lovely place for tourists to check out. Also acts as a great meeting point. Great place for shopping and to hang out. Also great to meet people from all over the world. This is the number one shopping district in San Francisco and there is always something going on. Right now a lot of construction is going on in this area, which will still take a while to be finished.This is a beautiful place however, I have mixed emotions because, it's a richy rich playground. No average person can afford to shop in the nearby stores so if you see in the park it could be a little bit depressing. I am very sorry to see the gentrification that is occurring daily in San Francisco, when I was a teenager I would ride my bike at Union Square doing all kinds of neat tricks and jumps, but today I don't believe that would be possible where are the kids supposed to play?Definitely a spot to visit. Union Square offers an open space for fun and relaxation in the middle of the shopping euphoria. It's surrounded by beautiful stores and in Christmas you can enjoy de skating rink as well as the beautiful decorations."

This place did not give me a ticket to get out instead they gave me my blue ticket back. I've never parked here so I didn't know any better. When I tried to exit and couldn't I explained to them what was happening . Instead of helping the manager coned my car in  blocking me from backing up. After arguing for awhile with manager she said I could pay another $45 that's almost $100 total to get out of garage . I did not pay I lifted the gate and me my wife and crying baby at this point drove out and home . I've never been treated so horrible my any company and will continue to post this if they remove it . I literally hate driving around SF during the holiday season. Especially when it's the weekend and you can't find parking anywhere nearby Union Square. I usually like to park my car at the Sutter and Stockton garage, because it's really cheap. Hey, it's the holidays!! You know how difficult it is to get around that area? Traffic! Don't fret my friends. I found a place you can park your car for less than $10 during the weekends.

$7 a day during the weekends, you can situate your luxurious or tugboat of a car here. Great find personally if you ask me. Walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown within a two minute walk, and neighboring areas. Why waste your time driving around Union Square? You'll pay an extra arm and a leg to park your car for two to three hours? Hell no! Park your car here as long as you want before 4am. $7 for more than half the day spent in SF? Hell yes!!

Warning! Don't be surprised when you drive inside and can't understand how to leave and get inside the garage, because their sense of directions is unnerving. Downside to that portion but overall, you're saving yourself the extra $20-30!!For unknown reasons, while my car was in the care of their Valet service, my hood was popped via the in-car lever. The car was returned to me in this condition. Since the hood was just popped but not fully unlatched, I didn't notice until ten minutes later when I was driving 70 mph on the freeway, and saw the hood start bobbing up and down in the wind. Luckily, I was able to get off the freeway quickly and shut it properly before anything bad happened.

Why did they pop the hood? The only legitimate excuse is that they thought it was the emergency brake release, but in that case once they realized their error, why did they not close the hood? The other possibility is that they thought it was the trunk release, which means they were looking for valuables to steal.

Either way, I will of course never park here again.comftableThey are complete idiots!  I had been hit by a hit-and-run driver while parked.  They showed no compassion and resisted filling out a claim form.  The parking ticket explains that all claims must be handled before leaving or the claim is void.  They tried to hustle me out without my claim form and took 20 min for what would have taken me 3. I would question if they're using legal labor."

The best part is you don't need to deal with the crowds down on the Wharf!Amazing place to play tennis. Wish there was a sign up on weekends so the turnover of courts could be smoother. Not everyone abides by the recommended 30-40 mins of play when there's people waiting.These tennis courts might have the best views in San Francisco, hands down.  If you want to play doubles, play in the center courts because the courts on the sides don't have painted alleys.

The answer is that I'm a sucker for virtual internet points (I'm almost a Google Level 3 Guide!) and I have no shame.

Anyway, I've been here twice while babysitting my friends' toddler and he just f@#$ing loved it, so I'm passing along what I assume would be his 4 star rating. Could have gotten 5 stars if there had been more random garbage for him to attempt to put in his mouth, but you can't have it all.I don't have kids, so I don't know about the playground, but the off leash dog park is wonderful. fenced off with picnic tables, water for you and your pooch, and plenty of room to run. I live in the neighborhood and this park is looked after by the residents.Fun play structure has long walkways that connect an artificial hill on one side with a real one on the other; a metal tube slide goes from the top of the hill down. The playground is in good condition. Basketball and tennis courts adjacent and baseball field and a rec center above. Restrooms are currently portable toilets due to construction.Good playground with a huge structure and lots of activities covering a good age range.  Bathrooms available most of the time at the rec center just up the hill.  Occasional drainage problems from problematic landscaping design choices, but nothing serious.  Supports a good age range.

Fenced all around, but there are a lot of easily-opened gates at different elevation levels and some vision blockers, so maintaining a perimeter around a group of kids requires several adults -- don't expect to be able to supervise from a single fixed location.What a fantastic playground.  There's toddler swings for the little ones, lots of playground equipment for the grade schoolers, and basketball/tennis courts for teens/adults.

It's clean, welcoming and we felt safe. A big thank-you to whoever maintains it because you're doing a wonderful job."

Nice environment, good beer and the popcorn chicken was on point. Worth it!My friend loves the corn here. That is all she talked about. I think it's OK. Fun place to eat though. The karaoke is mostly K-Pop and the American song selection was pretty dismal. The machine was also hard to use and didn't queue up any songs so you had to enter them one by one.

Food, drinks and service were great though!We came here on a late Saturday night after hanging out at the bar, since everyone was hungry and singing was on our mind. Their karaoke room pricing policy is a bit weird, but it's definitely on the pricier end, perhaps because they serve alcohol in the karaoke rooms. We were told it was a flat $20 for everyone to share the room for an hour, but each person would have to order a minimum of $30 of food and drink. Since there were 6 of us, we ended up ordering a lot of food. Fried chicken, tofu soup, garlic fries, rice cake and ramen, seafood pancake, and soju were just a few of the items we ordered. For the soju, you will get exactly 12 shot glass full of drinks from the ""large"" option, which is weird because the size is a ""small"" at other Korean bar places, like Dan Sung Sa in Oakland. 

Karaoke options were okay, not spectacular. No super recent songs, with only a few things from the past year so they don't update their song list often. 

Overall, mediocre food and karaoke experience. Really rude service, they repeatedly interrupted to demand we order more drinks, with a TWENTY DOLLAR MINIMUM for each person. The phone to order drinks was broken and the guy repeatedly talks to me like I'm retarded and it's my fault. Many interruptions by the guy while we are enjoying ourselves throughout our 2 hour time.
 
The guy ejects us a few minutes early like he's military then turns to talk to his friends instead of cashing me out. After a minute I tap him on the shoulder and he rudely complains that he's 'just doing his job' then flat out refuses to cash me out like an insolent teenager until I forced him by bringing up the tip. Just a terrible attitude towards us the whole night, like we were unwanted. Then he includes 18% gratuity on a 3 person group. Go to YamaSho, do not go here."

They don't build slides like this anymore.  This one is better than the others in GGP.A hidden gem in the city.  The park is super tiny, but known for it's concrete slides.  This will definitely bring out the little kid in you, and your inner dare devil.  The slides are pretty steep, so you get some decent speed.  You might even catch a little air (as was my experience).  There are usually pieces of cardboard at the park for you to use as your sliding mat (helps you go faster).  For the real thrill seekers, you can add sand to help you go even faster (not my choice - it goes fast enough without the added help).  A tip: keep you arms down by your side or you might bonk them if you catch air.  SO FUN! On a recent business trip, my coworker and I needed a little break in the day. Seward Street Slides came up in our search, so we headed over. 

SOOO fun to ride down these slides - literally in the middle of a neighborhood. 

Previous sliders had left cardboard, so all we had to do was pick up a cardboard box, make our way to the top and sliiiiiiiiiide down! 

Was the perfect break to the day - always fun to feel like a kid again - even if it only lasts for 10 minutes. (:It doesn't matter who you are. You have to come here and slide!!!!!Put this on your bucket list of ""lesser known things to do in the city"".

Its a reasonable walk from Dolores. hint: walk along 18th and then head south - if you walk along 20th you'll walk over 2 MASSIVE hills that, unless you need to build up some calf muscles, are totally unnecessary. 

Its not too difficult to find the slides.  They really are fun!  Bring your sense of adventure, rummage through the nearby recycling bins for a few pieces of cardboard to slide down on (please put them back), and giggle like you did in kindergarten!

A sign there says ""No Adults Unless Accompanied by a Child"".  This seems cute and quirky and we had a good laugh when we saw it.  

However....

...

The nearby residents are nasty as can be.  We had slid down twice, yelping and giggling with glee when one of the women arrived and started screaming like a banshee at us.  She told us it was meant for children only and NOT for adults and that we were being inconsiderate and horrible people for enjoying this public space.  We apologized and promised to keep it down, but this wasn't enough for this woman, she continued like a nagging fishwife.  She didn't even ask us to keep it down nicely.  She completely aggressive.  We were there at 2pm on a Saturday, in a space that is public property!  I could understand a good ear full if we were raucous, making a noise at an unreasonable hour and had done so for a long time.  However, we had literally been there for about 3 minutes.

Anyway my advice is to either keep it down, or otherwise be prepared to be yelled at or get into a fight with the witches - take someone who is good at arguing!  (a park is public property for everyone to enjoy, and I didnt think a few yelping sounds are beyond the noise ordinance's range.)  

One last thing.  It says that the park, on one sign, is open from sunrise to sunset and on another sign it says it closes at 5.  So I don't know about opening times...  I didn't see fences so I don't think they lock it up?  But reading some others' posts I am probably wrong."

It's great for people watching and just letting the day pass. I won't recommend the public toilet here so best to walk to one of the nearby cafes instead.My favorite park in San Francisco. Great for people watching and catching the best weather you will find in the city. Pick up some champagne, cheese and bread and bask in the sun. The city recently has done huge renovations to make the park even more beautiful and upgraded. Best spot to check out is the make-out bench as the highest corner. Enjoy one of the best views of the city.Warm sunny weather and green grass is all it takes for this park to fill up like they are showing movies or something.

I don't know the history of the park or who Dolores is, but it's been completely engulfed by the surrounding Castro.

Double slopped with the tennis courts at the bottom it's 80% grass with trees lining 2.5 of the 4 sides. Lots of urination and drinking going on around the edges and treeline, but for the most part it's easily the most popular park in the city for it's size, though not the larges, nicest, but it's capita use is legit.

Parking on weekends sucks, I think that's why it's always packed because so many locals just walk here while the tourists load the spots to go around the area versus the park.

There are a few kids playing, parents lounging, couples making out, lots of shirtless and pantless people along with tennis players, but the mix is way more local. Weekends are the worst and could circle for an hour without finding a spot and end up parking way far away, maybe even out of Castro."

Nice environment, good beer and the popcorn chicken was on point. Worth it!My friend loves the corn here. That is all she talked about. I think it's OK. Fun place to eat though. The karaoke is mostly K-Pop and the American song selection was pretty dismal. The machine was also hard to use and didn't queue up any songs so you had to enter them one by one.

Food, drinks and service were great though!We came here on a late Saturday night after hanging out at the bar, since everyone was hungry and singing was on our mind. Their karaoke room pricing policy is a bit weird, but it's definitely on the pricier end, perhaps because they serve alcohol in the karaoke rooms. We were told it was a flat $20 for everyone to share the room for an hour, but each person would have to order a minimum of $30 of food and drink. Since there were 6 of us, we ended up ordering a lot of food. Fried chicken, tofu soup, garlic fries, rice cake and ramen, seafood pancake, and soju were just a few of the items we ordered. For the soju, you will get exactly 12 shot glass full of drinks from the ""large"" option, which is weird because the size is a ""small"" at other Korean bar places, like Dan Sung Sa in Oakland. 

Karaoke options were okay, not spectacular. No super recent songs, with only a few things from the past year so they don't update their song list often. 

Overall, mediocre food and karaoke experience. Really rude service, they repeatedly interrupted to demand we order more drinks, with a TWENTY DOLLAR MINIMUM for each person. The phone to order drinks was broken and the guy repeatedly talks to me like I'm retarded and it's my fault. Many interruptions by the guy while we are enjoying ourselves throughout our 2 hour time.
 
The guy ejects us a few minutes early like he's military then turns to talk to his friends instead of cashing me out. After a minute I tap him on the shoulder and he rudely complains that he's 'just doing his job' then flat out refuses to cash me out like an insolent teenager until I forced him by bringing up the tip. Just a terrible attitude towards us the whole night, like we were unwanted. Then he includes 18% gratuity on a 3 person group. Go to YamaSho, do not go here."

Note: IT IS VERY MUCH OPEN ON SATURDAYS!! For the most part it's free of charge, although I believe swimming may cost a buck or two, which is an extremely small price to pay at a place that offers a giant indoor waterslide!! ( amazing!) I believe the woman I met our first day (several years ago) named RENÉE is actually the program manager. She was very nice, informational and attentive, I felt completely welcomed. At the time, my son was 8 or 9 and was a little shy initiating himself to shoot hoops in their enormous gym, since that portion of the program is more of and for teens. With a little encouragement from Ms.Renée and myself, he shot a few hoops and was quickly joined by others,it was such a warm experience. My son is now 11 and continues to attend Hamilton Rec.Center.most amenities aside from the basketball court are great. the basketball gym is crowded and has lots of dead spots on the dusty floor, and broken netsI only use the swimming pool here and it's well maintained and staff is super nice and friendly. For an experience of an absolutely jam packed pool, go no further than the open swims on the weekends here. Lifeguards are plentiful and attentive, catering to the families here. Great facilities that are never very crowded.  This is a public facility with no door charge that has two well-maintained tennis courts with lights (which is rare in this city), an indoor pool, three indoor basketball courts (as well a couple hoops outside on asphalt), and a big grassy field.  There's also a kids' playground.  The indoor basketball games can be pretty competitive."

They also have a lake inside the park, accompanied by rowing/canoeing, etc. Or could spend a day if not more wandering the park's interior. Of and they also have a Japanese rose garden inside, but it's not free. Parking is found around the park's exterior The classic Victorian Garden on steroids. This is the iconic example of the well loved Victorian Garden actually. Everything in the park was human planted and cultivated. It sits on top of what was miles of sand dunes in the 1800s. 
DeYoung, arboretum, and the buffalo pens are favorites. Look for the police on horseback! They are great people. Great, well-maintained, park! You can easily spend a whole day here, relaxing away from the noisy city. I like how the park is divided in multiple sections that all have their own feel and look to them.

People are pretty good about cleaning up after their dogs. We met some really nice people and our puppy had a great time. I love this park! It's great for dog-watching, and attracts a more Castro crowd than Mission hipster. 

It's a pretty small space, but it feels tucked away on side streets just near Market street. I go here to snag some sunlight on weeknights or slackline on weekends. On weekends the hill gets a bit more crowded with people having picnics or doing acro yoga. More low key than Dolores Park, where you will find people trying to get your attention with their freestyling or drum circle or costume party.One of the best in the city, sun, dogs, public transit nearby, basketball courts, and plenty of tasty food across the street at Duboce Park Cafe. Let's face it, proximity has a huge weight my judgement call here...But even if I weren't so close by, Duboce would still be up there for my of my favorite weekend destinations.  Fluffy dogs, fluffy grass, and a picnic blanket-- what more could you want?  On warm San Franciscan Saturday afternoons, Duboce is the escape you've always been looking for.  Grab a picnic blanket, a good book, and a snack, and you're set for the afternoon.  Duboce is a neighborhood gem fit for families and dog owners. Stick to Dolores if you're in the mood for youth and people-watching, but if you want someplace a bit less crowded and more intimate (and dog-friendly), go Duboce.  Oh, and don't forget to check out the Harvey Milk center right nearby.  It has restrooms and a good number of arts and crafts courses to choose from."

The staff is professional and attentive. It is a beautiful, well kept and clean facility. I am really glad we found this place. The other review, which talks about ""things stuffed to the ceilings"", has nothing to do with the Richmond Rec Center, at 251 18th Ave in San Francisco, which is a relatively new facility which includes a number of activities, including an indoor basketball court, and off-street parking.  It was built on property once called the Sutro Annex, owned by Park & Rec, and then transferred to the SF Unified School District, which used it for temporary school structures. 

After sitting closed and abandoned for years, the SFUSD sold it to developers who planned to build an over-sized multi-unit condo complex on the site. When the local neighbors learned of the project around 1986, and also discovered the rule-bending that had allowed the project to proceed, they formed a group called the Sutro Annex Neighborhood Group, with a membership of over 400.

After over two years of battles at City Hall, fund-raising (including a huge neighborhood garage sale that raised over $3,000 for legal fees), the S.A.N.G. prevailed, stopping the condo project in favor of building the Richmond Recreation Center, with both a unanimous decision in their favor  by the SF Board of Supervisors and a simultaneous executive order from then-Mayor Feinstein. The effect was to re-zone the location to prevent the condos, and to allow the building of the Rec Center. This place is packed with stuff, practically to the ceiling, so my girlfriend and I were excited to start looking through their MTG offerings. Well, sad to say the offerings were very weak, along with a strict 15 minute viewing limitation with a sign that tells people not to waste employees' valuable time. Really? Even with only 1 other customer in the whole store? 

Luckily, we already found a far superior store called Gator Games in San Mateo. If you're looking for standoffish employees and cheesy action figures, go to Cards and Comics. If you're a real player that likes to browse and buy with dorky (but it a good way) employees, skip this joint and head on over to Gator Games. Trust me, it's a much more satisfying experience."

They have their sacred hideout right behind the front entrance of Silver Terrace Playground and in front of the basketball court; you can't miss it.

One is 6'2"", other one is medium 5 7 - 5 8 at best, and the the other is a young chinese girl who happens to tag along where they go. they always stay together.

Thank you for bearing with me in this very conversation along with this request. I hope you can make do something with the information I gave you or anything at all. if you need to contact me for more clarification, ill be happy to oblige.The location is not the greatest, but this still manages to be a pretty good venue for soccer with its turf fields. There are bathrooms, but the doors don't really stay closed so it's good to take a partner if you need to go. There is a gas station near by but it doesn't even have a public restroom so you can't rely on that. The parking can be a little tough and sometimes I have to park down a residential street. In that case it is good to get a buddy to walk with you at night. When I have been there the lights are always working properly and things seem to be in order. It's not kept as nice as some other turf fields but it's good enough, and the turf is relatively new.Great place to play football A very mellow place to watch games recycle and what notAthletic fields seem nice and well used. playground has small, old green-painted wooden and metal structures. Clubhouse and restroom adjacent, but it was being used by teens smoking for a bit."

Nice environment, good beer and the popcorn chicken was on point. Worth it!My friend loves the corn here. That is all she talked about. I think it's OK. Fun place to eat though. The karaoke is mostly K-Pop and the American song selection was pretty dismal. The machine was also hard to use and didn't queue up any songs so you had to enter them one by one.

Food, drinks and service were great though!We came here on a late Saturday night after hanging out at the bar, since everyone was hungry and singing was on our mind. Their karaoke room pricing policy is a bit weird, but it's definitely on the pricier end, perhaps because they serve alcohol in the karaoke rooms. We were told it was a flat $20 for everyone to share the room for an hour, but each person would have to order a minimum of $30 of food and drink. Since there were 6 of us, we ended up ordering a lot of food. Fried chicken, tofu soup, garlic fries, rice cake and ramen, seafood pancake, and soju were just a few of the items we ordered. For the soju, you will get exactly 12 shot glass full of drinks from the ""large"" option, which is weird because the size is a ""small"" at other Korean bar places, like Dan Sung Sa in Oakland. 

Karaoke options were okay, not spectacular. No super recent songs, with only a few things from the past year so they don't update their song list often. 

Overall, mediocre food and karaoke experience. Really rude service, they repeatedly interrupted to demand we order more drinks, with a TWENTY DOLLAR MINIMUM for each person. The phone to order drinks was broken and the guy repeatedly talks to me like I'm retarded and it's my fault. Many interruptions by the guy while we are enjoying ourselves throughout our 2 hour time.
 
The guy ejects us a few minutes early like he's military then turns to talk to his friends instead of cashing me out. After a minute I tap him on the shoulder and he rudely complains that he's 'just doing his job' then flat out refuses to cash me out like an insolent teenager until I forced him by bringing up the tip. Just a terrible attitude towards us the whole night, like we were unwanted. Then he includes 18% gratuity on a 3 person group. Go to YamaSho, do not go here."

We saw several groups bouldering on giant rocks (awesome) and ran across some wildlife, including a snake and a family of groundhogs. Perfect and easy to get to if you're looking for a break from the city in nature. Glen Park helps you escape the commotion of the city without ever actually leaving the city. It's by far one of my favorite ""hikes"" to go on when I can't leave SF
Beautiful natural oasis in SF.  I go on runs here from Bernal Heights.  There are times when you can't see any signs of civilization while running.  Highly recommended. I wish there were views like at the other SF parks (which tend to be hills), but it's a canyon. Oh well. I saw three cool birds there on one run.While tiny in comparison to Golden Gate Park, it's an easy way to feel like you are in a forest preserve without ever leaving San Francisco.  You can hop on the the BART and it's only a short 10 minute walk to the entrance.  There are lots of very, very well behaved dogs.  Rather than mowed lawns and paved paths, this park is mostly dirt and gravel with a more wild feel to it.  From the center of the park, you see very few homes.  It's neat to watch the change of the seasonings as the hills turn from lush green to brown.  There's even a tiny marshy area with a wooden bridge over it. I like to sit on the rocks half way up the canyon and just relax.Amazing little get away for hikers living in the city. I enjoy walking through here and getting exercise. Lots of elevation changes and rocky landscapes."

Day or night this has some amazing views.  Tip:  don't go up if it's foggy, there is no point.No not the TV show from the 90's. Yes I'm that old and remember it. This is the literal and almost figurate center of the city. It is the highest geographical point and a great viewpoint for 360 degree views of the City. On a clear day it's windy, on a foggy day it's windy, actually it's windy all the time up here. Bring a jacket because it's like going to Alcatraz, colder than you'd think or expect. A couple hundred feet elevated from the sea it's not a massive peak, but there are 2 of them, hence the name. The more public one is lower, but if you're of able body and balance you can scamper to the higher peak, but it's like being on the end of a speed boat except the wind comes from all sides.

Beautiful and the north side exit is a very popular shot for many movies done in the SF region. It's really not as steep as you'd expect because it's really not as high as you'd think at just shy of 1000 feet above sea level. Apparently it's a lovely ride on a bike, but I'm never up here with mine. Come see for yourself it's a tourists paradise for pictures that go to the relatives. It's a little grungy up there with the spray can artist and kids smoking the reefer thinking it's so windy no one can smell it.Woo! One of my favorite spots to take people in the city, whether they're out-of-town visitors, or local residents who've never visited. Probably one of the best views in the city, as you get to look down on everything in a 180 angle north of this point, allowing for fantastic views of the Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, Downtown and Market Street, and much, much more.

The downsides? It's cold up here. Like, really cold. And windy. Also, don't make the mistake of coming up here when the fog is really heavy: not only is it a much more dangerous drive up the dark, windy road, you also won't be able to see much up here anyway!Great views! Terrible crime spot! If you leave valuables in your car your window will be broken, and a thief will take everything. The sad thing is the SFPD is aware of the problem but does little to fix the issue. If you are touring the SF area and want to visit the point, do so, but keep the things you care about back at the hotel. AN AMAZING VIEW OF SAN FRANCISCO. The roads can be dangerous but definitely worth the drive when you get up there.  Try to go when there's no fog (which is hard to determine) but if you go during the right time where its fog free, you get to see the beautiful city of San Francisco and all its glory."

Everyone comparing it to San Diego, OK, it's not San Diego. So are you incapable of enjoying yourself? The San Diego Zoo is one of the largest on Earth. It's also 8 hours away, and costs 2.5X as much money. I enjoy seeing a squirrel in a park. I don't think to myself ""Man this squirrel sucks because I'm not looking at an elephant."" If you can't appreciate the small things, you probably don't even get appreciating nature at all. But that's not even fair because the SF Zoo isn't even small. It's just not top 10 on Earth like S.D. is. Boo hoo. 

@Deo Shabir Hey dummy, you talk about how ""we"" all need to pony up to help the zoo get better. Meanwhile the only time you visit was on a free day. Good job. 

@Jesus Salcido-Duarte Do you even know what ""average"" means? The average zoo is in a small town with 1/4 the size and animals. While there are a few areas that have not been in use for a long time, the areas that are upkept are very nice to visit. Animals seem very well cared for and it doesnt creep you out to see them in such lush accommodations. I wish there was a better way to get there via train.Really cool large zoo in San Francisco! I enjoyed seeing the gorillas, chimps, giraffes, and even tigers!

The place was a real pleasure to walk around in and it's great to see the crazy amounts of animals in person! 

The only tips I can share is to go early, because the parking fills up very quickly! We were able to find parking outside of the parking lot luckily and walked down a bit. Food was a bit pricey as well, but I wasn't surprised.

Overall I enjoyed the day there!A zoo tucked on the very corner edge of the city. We got to see many animals, many in exhibits that seemed to provide enough open air play. Kids seemed to enjoy a lot of the exhibits. Be sure to check out the feeding schedules!Such a nice zoo to go to. Beat's the zoo's in Los Angeles for sure. It was a pleasure and it's amazing to walk around and see all the animals. Seeing them happy made me happy too."

Amazing place near downtownIna Coolbrith Park is one of my favorite San Francisco vantage points.  The park is small, but it's a great place to go for an evening stroll.  On multiple occasions I've seen folks walking their dogs.  There are a few park benches lining the paths to sit back and enjoy the day.  Parking can be quite tough in this area, but the view is worth it.

Very peaceful mix of diverse folks relaxing & co-existing in the sun and shade, consuming North Beach eats & drinking beer or wine. It's SF, so you have the homeless and eclectic, but saw no disturbances or scenes. It was all good.

A noteworthy mention - Coit Liquors right on the corner has an amazing selection of wine and fairly good guidance of what to buy to go with it. Saw a lot of folks walk directly from Coit to the park with wine or 6-pack in hand. Very convenient.Lively park in the heart of the village. Path for walking or running around the perimeter as well as a separate dog area. Often visited by many live music performers.This place is really pretty. It is super close to restaurants in North Beach, Lombart Street and Coit Tower, as well as the cathedral.

After seeing it during my first visit to San Francisco, I decided that this is where I'd propose to my girlfriend.  She said yes!A block away from the famed Lombard street lies this quaint little park quietly tucked behind white picket fences. It is unassuming and easy to miss, but provides an unexpected escape from the hustle and bustle of the city life. Inside the gates lie two gazebos, where you take sit down and take in the beautiful gardens. It almost feels like a secret garden that you discovered, and there is often nobody else there. There are set hours when this tiny park is technically open to the public, but the more daring of us can still find their way easily inside. It provides a romantic escape where you can enjoy someone's company privately.  A nearly hidden, secluded little park/garden near Lombard Street. Looks like a great spot for a photo shoot or a very small wedding ceremony - or to just sit and relax.Cute little park.  Great for family photos.可愛い庭園"
