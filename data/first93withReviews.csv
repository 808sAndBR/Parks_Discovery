It is bordered by scenic wonders of the California coast, beautiful beaches of the Pacific Ocean and hiking trails that are filled with wild life. Bird watching on hikes and picnics is really great. So, while the family enjoys the beach and hiking you can play golf then join them for swimming, surfing or hiking, bird watching and the picnic after your round.  

I've been playing Sharps for over 20 years. I've never seen it in better shape than at this point in time. Now, it's not 100% just yet. But the greens are better than I've ever seen them. And the fairways even with this horrible drought are in are in good shape and in some places they're as good as you'll get anywhere. I must admit 16,17 are so dried out it will be a wonder if they ever recover but with the great grounds crew they have those fairway will come back. 

Sharps is a terrific golf course challenging in its own way especially because your playing on an ocean fronted course. Ocean view golf is usually played out for multiple hundreds of dollars on courses like Spanish Bay, Torrey Pines or Pebble Beach, but Sharps is a Muni so the greens fees are a pittance in comparison.

The clubhouse staff, grounds keepers and Marshals are salt of the earth. The restaurant is pretty darn good . . . well, you know  . . . for golf course food it's better than most public courses.

It's not Saint Andrews, or Pebble Beach, or Harding or the Olympic club. It's not too challenging . . . so if you put three good shots together, per hole, it's fairly easy to break 90.

Once those 16 and 17th fairways are fixed this is a Five Star course any day of the week!
The front nine holes are terrible. Four of the nine holes had temporary ""greens"" on the fairway. You couldn't putt the ball. The back nine were better. The fairways are in poor condition but the greens are fine. This may be because of the drought. Other golf courses seem to be doing ok so I'm not sure what the deal is here. I guess you get what you pay for. I'd much rather drive to Poplar Creek in San Mateo or just play the 9 holes at Fleming.There's lots of wildlife there, including the rare and beautiful San Francisco Garter Snake and its prey species, the California Red Legged Frog. The golf course is sited on a wetland, and just recentyl, SF Rec & Park got the ok to channelize the streams - so they can manage the wetland for a golf course. This will remove wetlands for wildlife.  The two times I had breakfast there the coffee cake was burned, and the coffee was weak.A beautiful area that should be available to everyone and turned into a national park. Whoever made this a golf course did not think about sharing the beauty with all earth citizens. Shut it down.Great value for money. Greens are getting better, but still pretty slow. It's a great place to just walk, loosen your muscles and practice.",ChIJ-1L_KFp6j4ARaoyVoHn9cKw

Not as big or popular like the big apple, but it holds a tradition. Union hold monthly events during warmer weather months. Winter holidays they've ice skating. Small boutique shops as well as big brand name shops are abundance. Love this area as I can play tourist just to get a feel what's its like. It never disappoint me due to the fact that transportation brings you in the heart of the action.This is a beautiful place however, I have mixed emotions because, it's a richy rich playground. No average person can afford to shop in the nearby stores so if you see in the park it could be a little bit depressing. I am very sorry to see the gentrification that is occurring daily in San Francisco, when I was a teenager I would ride my bike at Union Square doing all kinds of neat tricks and jumps, but today I don't believe that would be possible where are the kids supposed to play?A wide open area which hosts many events: Christmas tree lightings, ice skatings, and more! An awesome place to visit if you're visiting San Francisco. It does get cold at night, so definitely bring a jacket!Definitely a spot to visit. Union Square offers an open space for fun and relaxation in the middle of the shopping euphoria. It's surrounded by beautiful stores and in Christmas you can enjoy de skating rink as well as the beautiful decorations.What more can be said about Union Square in SF? This area hosts loads of events, an ice skating rink during winter, and picture-worthy parts everywhere! The hearts at each corner are especially popular for your tourist pictures. 

Recently, the square has been surrounded by construction, so driving around the area is a nightmare. The parking lot is still open though, if you're willing to tough it out through the traffic. ",ChIJJ6m71o6AhYARiUxigIz3gLw

This place did not give me a ticket to get out instead they gave me my blue ticket back. I've never parked here so I didn't know any better. When I tried to exit and couldn't I explained to them what was happening . Instead of helping the manager coned my car in  blocking me from backing up. After arguing for awhile with manager she said I could pay another $45 that's almost $100 total to get out of garage . I did not pay I lifted the gate and me my wife and crying baby at this point drove out and home . I've never been treated so horrible my any company and will continue to post this if they remove it . I literally hate driving around SF during the holiday season. Especially when it's the weekend and you can't find parking anywhere nearby Union Square. I usually like to park my car at the Sutter and Stockton garage, because it's really cheap. Hey, it's the holidays!! You know how difficult it is to get around that area? Traffic! Don't fret my friends. I found a place you can park your car for less than $10 during the weekends.

$7 a day during the weekends, you can situate your luxurious or tugboat of a car here. Great find personally if you ask me. Walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown within a two minute walk, and neighboring areas. Why waste your time driving around Union Square? You'll pay an extra arm and a leg to park your car for two to three hours? Hell no! Park your car here as long as you want before 4am. $7 for more than half the day spent in SF? Hell yes!!

Warning! Don't be surprised when you drive inside and can't understand how to leave and get inside the garage, because their sense of directions is unnerving. Downside to that portion but overall, you're saving yourself the extra $20-30!!comftableFor unknown reasons, while my car was in the care of their Valet service, my hood was popped via the in-car lever. The car was returned to me in this condition. Since the hood was just popped but not fully unlatched, I didn't notice until ten minutes later when I was driving 70 mph on the freeway, and saw the hood start bobbing up and down in the wind. Luckily, I was able to get off the freeway quickly and shut it properly before anything bad happened.

Why did they pop the hood? The only legitimate excuse is that they thought it was the emergency brake release, but in that case once they realized their error, why did they not close the hood? The other possibility is that they thought it was the trunk release, which means they were looking for valuables to steal.

Either way, I will of course never park here again.They are complete idiots!  I had been hit by a hit-and-run driver while parked.  They showed no compassion and resisted filling out a claim form.  The parking ticket explains that all claims must be handled before leaving or the claim is void.  They tried to hustle me out without my claim form and took 20 min for what would have taken me 3. I would question if they're using legal labor.",ChIJv0JHy4uAhYAR4XqkTO2pCLk

The answer is that I'm a sucker for virtual internet points (I'm almost a Google Level 3 Guide!) and I have no shame.

Anyway, I've been here twice while babysitting my friends' toddler and he just f@#$ing loved it, so I'm passing along what I assume would be his 4 star rating. Could have gotten 5 stars if there had been more random garbage for him to attempt to put in his mouth, but you can't have it all.I don't have kids, so I don't know about the playground, but the off leash dog park is wonderful. fenced off with picnic tables, water for you and your pooch, and plenty of room to run. I live in the neighborhood and this park is looked after by the residents.Fun play structure has long walkways that connect an artificial hill on one side with a real one on the other; a metal tube slide goes from the top of the hill down. The playground is in good condition. Basketball and tennis courts adjacent and baseball field and a rec center above. Restrooms are currently portable toilets due to construction.Good playground with a huge structure and lots of activities covering a good age range.  Bathrooms available most of the time at the rec center just up the hill.  Occasional drainage problems from problematic landscaping design choices, but nothing serious.  Supports a good age range.

Fenced all around, but there are a lot of easily-opened gates at different elevation levels and some vision blockers, so maintaining a perimeter around a group of kids requires several adults -- don't expect to be able to supervise from a single fixed location.What a fantastic playground.  There's toddler swings for the little ones, lots of playground equipment for the grade schoolers, and basketball/tennis courts for teens/adults.

The nearby food and shops are good too, so you can grab a bite to eat and take it out on the grass.This is my local park and during spring summer and fall my wife or i bring our dog here at least once a day.  During the week, the long grass field is mostly used as a dog park and 95% of the dogs are well behaved.  The problem is the drainage of the field is horrible and during the winter's rains the park is not usuable without coating your shoes and your dog in mud.  Charlie's coffee is our morning stop and anchors the community.  The far end of the park has a fenced in children's playground and is always at least half filled with families.

Nice environment, good beer and the popcorn chicken was on point. Worth it!My friend loves the corn here. That is all she talked about. I think it's OK. Fun place to eat though. The karaoke is mostly K-Pop and the American song selection was pretty dismal. The machine was also hard to use and didn't queue up any songs so you had to enter them one by one.

Food, drinks and service were great though!We came here on a late Saturday night after hanging out at the bar, since everyone was hungry and singing was on our mind. Their karaoke room pricing policy is a bit weird, but it's definitely on the pricier end, perhaps because they serve alcohol in the karaoke rooms. We were told it was a flat $20 for everyone to share the room for an hour, but each person would have to order a minimum of $30 of food and drink. Since there were 6 of us, we ended up ordering a lot of food. Fried chicken, tofu soup, garlic fries, rice cake and ramen, seafood pancake, and soju were just a few of the items we ordered. For the soju, you will get exactly 12 shot glass full of drinks from the ""large"" option, which is weird because the size is a ""small"" at other Korean bar places, like Dan Sung Sa in Oakland. 

Karaoke options were okay, not spectacular. No super recent songs, with only a few things from the past year so they don't update their song list often. 

Overall, mediocre food and karaoke experience. Really rude service, they repeatedly interrupted to demand we order more drinks, with a TWENTY DOLLAR MINIMUM for each person. The phone to order drinks was broken and the guy repeatedly talks to me like I'm retarded and it's my fault. Many interruptions by the guy while we are enjoying ourselves throughout our 2 hour time.
 
The guy ejects us a few minutes early like he's military then turns to talk to his friends instead of cashing me out. After a minute I tap him on the shoulder and he rudely complains that he's 'just doing his job' then flat out refuses to cash me out like an insolent teenager until I forced him by bringing up the tip.

They don't build slides like this anymore.  This one is better than the others in GGP.A hidden gem in the city.  The park is super tiny, but known for it's concrete slides.  This will definitely bring out the little kid in you, and your inner dare devil.  The slides are pretty steep, so you get some decent speed.  You might even catch a little air (as was my experience).  There are usually pieces of cardboard at the park for you to use as your sliding mat (helps you go faster).  For the real thrill seekers, you can add sand to help you go even faster (not my choice - it goes fast enough without the added help).  A tip: keep you arms down by your side or you might bonk them if you catch air.  SO FUN! On a recent business trip, my coworker and I needed a little break in the day. Seward Street Slides came up in our search, so we headed over. 

SOOO fun to ride down these slides - literally in the middle of a neighborhood. 

Previous sliders had left cardboard, so all we had to do was pick up a cardboard box, make our way to the top and sliiiiiiiiiide down! 

Was the perfect break to the day - always fun to feel like a kid again - even if it only lasts for 10 minutes. (:Put this on your bucket list of ""lesser known things to do in the city"".

Its a reasonable walk from Dolores. hint: walk along 18th and then head south - if you walk along 20th you'll walk over 2 MASSIVE hills that, unless you need to build up some calf muscles, are totally unnecessary. 

Its not too difficult to find the slides.  They really are fun!  Bring your sense of adventure, rummage through the nearby recycling bins for a few pieces of cardboard to slide down on (please put them back), and giggle like you did in kindergarten!

A sign there says ""No Adults Unless Accompanied by a Child"".  This seems cute and quirky and we had a good laugh when we saw it.  

However....

...

The nearby residents are nasty as can be.  We had slid down twice, yelping and giggling with glee when one of the women arrived and started screaming like a banshee at us.  She told us it was meant for children only and NOT for adults and that we were being inconsiderate and horrible people for enjoying this public space.  We apologized and promised to keep it down, but this wasn't enough for this woman, she continued like a nagging fishwife.  She didn't even ask us to keep it down nicely.  She completely aggressive.  We were there at 2pm on a Saturday, in a space that is public property!  I could understand a good ear full if we were raucous, making a noise at an unreasonable hour and had done so for a long time.  However, we had literally been there for about 3 minutes.

Anyway my advice is to either keep it down, or otherwise be prepared to be yelled at or get into a fight with the witches - take someone who is good at arguing!  (a park is public property for everyone to enjoy, and I didnt think a few yelping sounds are beyond the noise ordinance's range.)  

One last thing.  It says that the park, on one sign, is open from sunrise to sunset and on another sign it says it closes at 5.  So I don't know about opening times...  I didn't see fences so I don't think they lock it up?  But reading some others' posts I am probably wrong.This place may be hard to find: just proceed South on Douglass past that nice Victorian, and turn left onto Seward just before Douglass turns into steps. If you do climb the steps, turn right onto Corwin and stop to read the poem etched into the sidewalk. My experience: better than the Esmeralda slide, it has a smooth cement surface enhanced by the use of cardboard. If you might want to slow down (why?) you can use gloves. Corwin community gardens are just uphill but why stop there when Kite Hill is so close? Closed Mondays but this is probably not enforced.

Families and hipsters, all mixing together.Sept 2015 - Large park with a sloping hill. On a nice warm day, you'll find it crowded with people from all walks of life. It's great for people watching and just letting the day pass. I won't recommend the public toilet here so best to walk to one of the nearby cafes instead.My favorite park in San Francisco. Great for people watching and catching the best weather you will find in the city. Pick up some champagne, cheese and bread and bask in the sun. The city recently has done huge renovations to make the park even more beautiful and upgraded. Best spot to check out is the make-out bench as the highest corner. Enjoy one of the best views of the city.Warm sunny weather and green grass is all it takes for this park to fill up like they are showing movies or something.

I don't know the history of the park or who Dolores is, but it's been completely engulfed by the surrounding Castro.

Double slopped with the tennis courts at the bottom it's 80% grass with trees lining 2.5 of the 4 sides. Lots of urination and drinking going on around the edges and treeline, but for the most part it's easily the most popular park in the city for it's size, though not the larges, nicest, but it's capita use is legit.

Parking on weekends sucks, I think that's why it's always packed because so many locals just walk here while the tourists load the spots to go around the area versus the park.

There are a few kids playing, parents lounging, couples making out, lots of shirtless and pantless people along with tennis players, but the mix is way more local. Weekends are the worst and could circle for an hour without finding a spot and end up parking way far away, maybe even out of Castro.",ChIJp3CqeRd-j4ARYI0i8e_kGKY

Nice environment, good beer and the popcorn chicken was on point. Worth it!My friend loves the corn here. That is all she talked about. I think it's OK. Fun place to eat though. The karaoke is mostly K-Pop and the American song selection was pretty dismal. The machine was also hard to use and didn't queue up any songs so you had to enter them one by one.

Food, drinks and service were great though!We came here on a late Saturday night after hanging out at the bar, since everyone was hungry and singing was on our mind. Their karaoke room pricing policy is a bit weird, but it's definitely on the pricier end, perhaps because they serve alcohol in the karaoke rooms. We were told it was a flat $20 for everyone to share the room for an hour, but each person would have to order a minimum of $30 of food and drink. Since there were 6 of us, we ended up ordering a lot of food. Fried chicken, tofu soup, garlic fries, rice cake and ramen, seafood pancake, and soju were just a few of the items we ordered. For the soju, you will get exactly 12 shot glass full of drinks from the ""large"" option, which is weird because the size is a ""small"" at other Korean bar places, like Dan Sung Sa in Oakland. 

Karaoke options were okay, not spectacular. No super recent songs, with only a few things from the past year so they don't update their song list often. 

Overall, mediocre food and karaoke experience. Really rude service, they repeatedly interrupted to demand we order more drinks, with a TWENTY DOLLAR MINIMUM for each person. The phone to order drinks was broken and the guy repeatedly talks to me like I'm retarded and it's my fault. Many interruptions by the guy while we are enjoying ourselves throughout our 2 hour time.
 
The guy ejects us a few minutes early like he's military then turns to talk to his friends instead of cashing me out. After a minute I tap him on the shoulder and he rudely complains that he's 'just doing his job' then flat out refuses to cash me out like an insolent teenager until I forced him by bringing up the tip. Just a terrible attitude towards us the whole night, like we were unwanted. Then he includes 18% gratuity on a 3 person group. Go to YamaSho, do not go here.",ChIJcZgi1biAhYARI53LoegJhLg
